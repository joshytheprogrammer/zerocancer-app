              Yes — if you qualify for a sponsored screening or refer 10 people
              using your link, you can get screened at no cost. You can also
              choose to pay directly if you prefer.

              How do I know if I'm eligible for screening?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Eligibility for sponsored screening is based on various factors,
              including age, family history, and risk factors. You can complete our
              online assessment to see if you qualify.
